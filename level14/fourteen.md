# Activity 14: Badge and Tag Components

**Objective:** Create badge and tag components for labels and status indicators.

**Tasks:**
1. Add `rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm` to all `<span>` elements in the "Status Badges" section - creates badge shape
2. The color variants are already applied (bg-blue-100, bg-green-100, etc.), but ensure each badge has the correct background and text color classes
3. Add `inline-flex items-center` to all `<span>` elements in the "Status Badges" section - proper alignment
4. Add `font-semibold` to all `<span>` elements in the "Status Badges" section - better readability
5. Add `rounded-md px-3 py-1 text-sm` to all `<span>` elements in the "Tags" section - creates tag style (not rounded-full)

**Key Concepts:**
- Creating variant components
- Using inline-flex for inline components
- Color variants for different states
- Badge vs tag styling differences
